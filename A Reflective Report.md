I learn a lot throughout this project as it is my first using Pycharm and I was so excited when I saw the panda moving. I succeed in making the panda move, stopping the camera rotation and putting music inside as well. I ask some lecturers to get more info and they help me in starting the project for the basics and then I'm on my own. I tried to search some practices in panda3d and found solutions as I understand little or the coding terminology and where to put the code in. The coding journey may be tough and requires a lot of effort to write a program but it can be worthwile if you try. I also thought that coding is by copying the code other people do but it is a lot more than that actually. That is why I use the github code by Dr. Phil to learn about copyrights. Dependencies is downloaded to get the build models like the forest. VCS can be used for other programmer to work together as it is important to always update the code and it help me to work on both personal machines and university machine. I hope that I can make more code in the future.
